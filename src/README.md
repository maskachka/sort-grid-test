In App.js, use the provided sample data (mocks/grid-data.json) to render a table with headings. Add some basic styling and provide sorting functionality.

<!-- Requirements -->

1. Render data from mocks/grid-data.json in a table
2. The table should have column headings based on the data fields
3. Format heading names to be more readable, e.g. first_name => First Name
4. Add basic styling. Looking for something like alternating row backgrounds, different styling for header
5. Add sort functionality. When a column heading is clicked, the column is sorted in ascending order. When it's clicked again, the column is sorted in descending order.
